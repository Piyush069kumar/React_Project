This is a regular expression (regex) pattern that matches certain characters. It’s written inside /.../.

The brackets [...] define a character set, meaning:

| Part | Meaning                               |
| ---- | ------------------------------------- |
| `\d` | Any digit (same as `[0-9]`)           |
| `+`  | The plus sign `+`                     |
| `\-` | The minus sign `-` (escaped with `\`) |
| `*`  | The asterisk `*` (multiplication)     |
| `/`  | The forward slash `/` (division)      |
| `.`  | The period `.` (decimal point)        |
| Symbol  | Meaning                                                        |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `^`     | Start of string                                                |
| `[...]` | Character set: match one of these                              |
| `\d`    | Digit (0–9)                                                    |
| `+`     | Match one or more of the previous (character set in this case) |
| `$`     | End of string                                                  |

.test(key) checks if the pressed key is one of those.

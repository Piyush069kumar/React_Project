# 🤷‍♂️ Smart Counter App

A simple yet powerful **React-based Smart Counter** application that allows you to increment, decrement, reset, and countdown a numeric value. The current counter value is persisted in `localStorage`, so it survives page reloads. Styled beautifully with Tailwind CSS and enhanced with icons from `react-icons`.
